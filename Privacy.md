UK Data & AI Job Assistant ("we," "our," or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data within our Chrome extension.

1. Information We Collect and Use
Our extension is designed to help you tailor job applications. To do this, we interact with the following data:

Website Content: We extract the text of job descriptions from LinkedIn and Indeed only when you click the "Analyse" button.

User Input: We process the CV text you paste into the extension.

API Keys: We store your Gemini API key locally in your browser to facilitate the AI analysis.

Encryption: Data transmitted to the Gemini API is sent using modern cryptography (HTTPS).

3. Data Sharing and Third Parties
We do not sell, rent, or trade your data to third parties. The only third party that receives data is Google (Gemini API), which processes the job description and CV text to generate your tailored content.

We use the data only to provide the primary feature of tailoring job applications.
