# Privacy Policy for UK Data & AI Job Assistant

**Last Updated:** January 19, 2026

UK Data & AI Job Assistant ("we," "our," or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This document outlines our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your information when you use our Chrome extension.

---

## 1. Single Purpose
The primary purpose of this extension is to assist job seekers in the UK Data & AI sector by extracting job descriptions from supported platforms (LinkedIn and Indeed) and providing AI-powered CV tailoring and cover letter generation.

## 2. Information Collection and Use
We collect and process the following types of data:

* **Website Content:** When you click the "Analyse" button, the extension reads the text of the job description on your active tab.
* **User Input (CV Data):** We process the CV or resume text that you manually paste into the extension's interface.
* **API Credentials:** We store your Google Gemini API key to facilitate the connection between the extension and the AI model.

## 3. Data Storage and Security
* **Local Storage:** Your CV text and API key are stored **locally** on your device using `chrome.storage.local`. We do not host a database, and we do not store your information on our own servers.
* **Modern Cryptography:** All data sent to the Gemini API is transmitted via secure **HTTPS** connections to ensure it remains private during transit.

## 4. Limited Use Disclosure
**The use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the Chrome Web Store User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.**

Specifically, we:
* Do not use or transfer the data for serving ads, including retargeting or personalized advertising.
* Do not allow humans to read user data unless we have obtained your explicit agreement for specific troubleshooting purposes.
* Limit the use of data strictly to providing or improving the CV tailoring and job analysis features of the extension.

## 5. Third-Party Sharing
The extension only shares job description and CV data with the **Google Gemini API** for the sole purpose of generating AI responses. We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your data to any other third parties or data brokers.

## 6. User Rights and Data Deletion
Since all data is stored locally in your browser, you have full control over it. You can delete your data at any time by:
1.  Clearing the text fields within the extension popup.
2.  Removing the extension via `chrome://extensions`.

## 7. Contact
If you have any questions or suggestions regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us via nitishgalat7@gmail.com.
